Business and System Design Documents

Liam, the owner of DriverPass, has noticed a gap in the training of soon-to-be drivers that has caused many people to fail their driving tests at the DMV. DriverPass will offer online classes, practice tests as well as in-person driving instruction to their clients. Their clients are likely the parents of prospective drivers, but the users of the application will be the student drivers themselves. 

The System needs to allow for users to register for driving training, include multiple packages with various benefits, have multiple roles that have access to certain information, facilitate login/registration, include online classes and practice tests and more. 

What did you do particularly well?

This project allowed me to examine an interview and design an application based on client's needs. I believe I excelled at not only designing a system that fits the client needs, but also fits the expectation the average user has for a system today. I was also able to translate the needs of the business from clients into a design that fits their needs. Without being able to ask follow up questions, I did a great job using prior knowledge and industry standards as well as common user expectations to design a system that works for all. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

When designing the login and registration system, I did not include password resetting in the diagram. In Hindsight, this should have been included as it is part of the login process. However, when initially designing the sytem, I planned on making this a separate diagram as two-factor authentication and multiple password recovery paths would have complicated the diagram. I still believe this would have been better suited to it's own diagram but I should have at least included the password reset action in the diagram. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I think you can rely on both your experience as a person who uses applications as well as prior experience of developing systems to consider the needs of the end user. I had to think about what the system needs to do to fit the needs of DriverPass as well as what a user would need to be able to use the program easily. I believe a minimalist approach is key here. The question I asked myself continually is how can we design the application to fit the needs of all user roles while also making sure we are reusing functionality whenever possible and making navigation simple for the user? 

The user's needs are probably the most important of anyone. I'm sure DriverPass would agree that the users are their clients and the ones that generate income for the business. That means they are also our clients and to take care of DriverPass means to also take care of their clients. If users don't want to use the application, then businesses will suffer. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I like to consider the functionalities of the system first. Then I like to think about the flow of data as well as the objects needed for it to run. I was able to understand the impact that design and business documents can have on a dev team. I think this is a key piece to communication and planning going forward and can not only cut development time but it can also deliver a better project as design flaws and improvements can be exposed earlier in the process.
